# C3Runner

C3Runner is a game where you race your opponents to see who reaches the goal first. Filled with obstacles and powerups, it's a race track set in Spain, where you travel across several landmarks in the Region of Murcia such as the Roman Theatre from Cartagena or the Cathedral of Murcia.

It also includes 2D minigame sections with different mechanics and gimmicks, which you need to beat in order to continue the race. One of them already uploaded here, Spider2D.

Developed by José Arjona Ortiz, José Luis Muñoz González and Daniel Colmena Martos.
